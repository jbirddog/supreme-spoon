# Supreme Spoon

`Supreme Spoon` leverages [SpiffWorkflow](https://github.com/sartography/SpiffWorkflow) to compile BPMN based 
workflows into a standalone Python class which can be imported into any application. The aim is to reduce 
fricition during the integration, deployment and distribution of BPMN based applications.

This is very much a work in progress. The current output supports basic CLI integration. `Manual Tasks` have basic support. `User Tasks` are missing.

Currently all BPMN files tested have been generated with the [spiffworkflow-frontend](https://github.com/sartography/spiff-arena/tree/main/spiffworkflow-frontend).

Lots to do, including making this README better.

## Install

`poetry install`

## Compile

To compile all examples, from the root run `./bin/build_examples`. To compile a single BPMN file to a standalone 
Python file:

`poetry run python supreme_spoon/compile.py [PROCESS_ID] [INPUT_FILE] [OUTPUT_FILE]`

For example, to compile the example parallel gateway + manual task workflow:

```
poetry run python supreme_spoon/compile.py "ParallelGatewayManualWorkflow" \
  examples/parallel_gateway_manual/bpmn/parallel_gateway_manual.bpmn \
  examples/parallel_gateway_manual/generated/parallel_gateway_manual.py
```

## Execute

`python examples/man_pg.py`
